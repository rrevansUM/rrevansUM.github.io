      <description>IntroIâ€™ve come across countless blogs (Detroit data lab, Data Science +, many others) attempting to cover the breadth of linear algebra using R, but each and every one of them peters out after some time. In this blog I would like to change that by exhausting myself, with the help of TV and others, to provide a complete treatment of Matrix Algebra for Statistics. Additionally, since many other blogs have tackled the basics, I will be skipping most of the theory and computation of the 1st chapter of Harville, opting instead to list a few important concepts to carry forward.</description>
